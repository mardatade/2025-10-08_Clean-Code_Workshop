# Refactoring

Here's a set of Jupyter notebook reflecting a short (made up) research project investigating relationships between biological, chemical, and physical properties in the Ocean.

Currently, there's two parts:

1. The [library](library.ipynb) notebook, which contains auxiliary functionality to be used in the investigation.

2. The [application](application.ipynb) notebook, which contains code for a specific analysis performed in the research project.

_**Note** that there also is a [_data_preparation](_data_preparation.ipynb) notebook, which was used to prepare example datasets. It's not really recommended to work on this part during the workshop. But if you're interested in the origins of the data, feel free to have a look._
